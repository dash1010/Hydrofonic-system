# Hydrofonic-system 
Hydroponic systems are indoor gardening solutions that utilize a soil-less method of growing plants, typically in water-based environments enriched with essential nutrients. They provide an excellent method for cultivating plants in limited space, offering a controlled environment that minimizes potential exposure to pests and disease. These compact systems may range from simple homemade setups to advanced kits with automation capabilities, and can grow a wide variety of plants, including leafy greens, herbs, and small fruiting plants. Small hydroponic systems make year-round indoor gardening accessible to everyone, from urban dwellers to classroom educators, and they offer the benefit of faster plant growth and higher yields compared to traditional soil-based gardening.
In our project, we created an advanced, self-regulated hydroponic system designed to automate the process of creating optimal conditions for plant growth. This system integrated real-time monitoring of the growth environment using pH, temperature, and EC (Electrical Conductivity) sensors into a compact hydroponic setup. These sensors were interfaced with peristaltic pumps and tubes, responsible for the precise delivery of buffers and fertilizers. The pumps, controlled by my custom-programmed algorithm, adjusted the pH, temperature, and nutrient levels in the hydroponic solution based on the feedback from the sensors. This innovative system enabled the hydroponic setup to self-balance, effectively streamlining the cultivation process, minimizing manual oversight, and maximizing plant growth.
### EC
In hydroponics, the EC (Electrical Conductivity) measure can serve as an index of the quantity of dissolved ions, and consequently, the potency of a nutrient blend. The most frequently utilized conductivity gauge in hydroponics is the four-electrode sensor. This device offers a confined spectrum but is reasonably affordable. For the majority of plants, you'll want the EC measure to oscillate between 1.2-1.6 during the growth phase and 1.6-2.4 during the flowering stage. However, these ranges may vary according to the specific plant species.
### pH
A pH examination reveals whether a substance is acidic or alkaline. The pH scale spans from 0 to 14, with 0 indicating extreme acidity, 14 representing extreme alkalinity, and 7 being the neutral point. Nutrient blends for hydroponic culture should ideally have a pH from 5.5 to 6.5 (usually around 6), ensuring that the pH in the root environment remains within 6.5 to 7. It is within this pH range that nutrients are most efficiently absorbed by plants.
### Temperature
The heat level of the nutrient mix can significantly impact a variety of crucial variables, most notably the solubility of oxygen and the metabolic rate of plants. As the heat level increases, the pace of metabolic reactions in the plants also speeds up. The optimal temperature for the nutrient mix generally falls between 18°C and 24°C. Some plants, such as kale, lisianthus, and blueberries prefer the cooler spectrum, while crops like chili peppers, squash, and marijuana fare better closer to 24°C.
