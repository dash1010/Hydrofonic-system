# Experiment
With the help of exporting the data to the ThingSpeak website we can monitor the various parameters in the system. By following the data online we can monitor the plants far away from the system and be alerted to everything that is happening.
On the temperature variables we witness the drastic changes between the day and night. We can also notice the power outage on July 4th.
