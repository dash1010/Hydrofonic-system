# Experiment
With the help of exporting the data to the ThingSpeak website we can monitor the various parameters in the system. By following the data online we can monitor the plants far away from the system and be alerted to everything that is happening.
On the temperature variables we witness the drastic changes between the day and night. We can also notice the power outage on July 4th.

We did have a problem with the pH meter that didn’t work properly. In an ideal situation we should notice small ups and downs of the pH system trying to balance itself to the wanted pH value.

Because the water tank is closed, we didn’t witness any water shortage in this short amount of time. But thanks to the water level sensor it makes monitoring very easy and we can fill it when we see a drop in the graph.
